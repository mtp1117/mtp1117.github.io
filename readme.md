Left to do for HOME page: 
1. --
2. Create plugin for "Get Quote" 
3. add bar under title in navigation when that tab is selected
4. hamburger option (now turned off) when size is minimized.
5. At end, will break up into individual css tabs (all together for now)
...
FIX:
1. side laptop image to the right of listed text (which needs to be in 2 columns)
2. logos on footer. How do I add white lines in grid? How do I break them into row of 4 all full scale, row at 3 at smaller scale, etc.
